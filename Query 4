Goal:
We have two tables. One table has all $ transactions from users during the month of March and one for the month of April.
Write a query that returns the total amount of money spent by each user. That is, the sum of the column transaction_amount for each user over both tables.
Write a query that returns day by day the cumulative sum of money spent by each user. 
That is, each day a user had a transcation, we should have how much money she has spent in total until that day. 
Obviously, the last day cumulative sum should match the numbers from the previous bullet point.

My code:
SELECT user_id, date, SUM(amount) over(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY date) as total_amount
FROM(
	SELECT user_id, date, sum(amount) as amount
	FROM
	(
		SELECT user_id, date, transaction_amount as amount
		FROM query_four_march
		UNION ALL
		SELECT user_id, date, transaction_amount as amount
		FROM query_four_april
		ORDER BY user_id, date
	) tmp
	GROUP BY user_id, date
	ORDER BY user_id, date
)TTT
