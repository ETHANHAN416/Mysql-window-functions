Goal:
We define as power users those users who bought at least 10 products. 
Write a query that returns for each user on which day they became a power user. 
That is, for each user, on which day they bought the 10th item. The table below represents transactions. 
That is, each row means that the corresponding user has bought something on that date.

My code:
SELECT user_id, date 
FROM(
	SELECT user_id, date, RANK()OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY date asc) as rk 
	FROM query_three
)T
where rk = 10
order by user_id
