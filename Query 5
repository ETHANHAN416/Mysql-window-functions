Goal
We have two tables. 
One is user id and their signup date. 
The other one shows all transactions done by those users, when the transaction happens and its corresponding dollar amount.
Find the average and median transaction amount only considering those transactions that happen on the same date as that user signed-up.

MY code:
1.
SELECT AVG(AMOUNT) AS MED 
FROM(	
	SELECT AMOUNT, FREQ, @SUM AS S1, @SUM:=@SUM+FREQ AS S2, TOTAL
	FROM(
		SELECT T.transaction_amount AS AMOUNT, COUNT(T.transaction_amount) AS FREQ 
		From query_five_users U
		LEFT JOIN query_five_transactions T ON T.user_id = U.user_id AND DATE_FORMAT(T.transaction_date,'%Y-%m-%d') = U.sign_up_date
		GROUP BY T.transaction_amount
		ORDER BY T.transaction_amount
	)T1, (SELECT @SUM:=0)AS T2, (
		SELECT COUNT(T.transaction_amount) AS TOTAL 
		FROM query_five_users U
		LEFT JOIN query_five_transactions T ON T.user_id = U.user_id AND DATE_FORMAT(T.transaction_date,'%Y-%m-%d') = U.sign_up_date)T3
)TMP 
WHERE S1<=TOTAL/2 AND S2>=TOTAL/2

2.
SELECT avg(T.transaction_amount) as avg
From query_five_users U
LEFT JOIN query_five_transactions T ON T.user_id = U.user_id AND DATE_FORMAT(T.transaction_date,'%Y-%m-%d') = U.sign_up_date
