Goal:
We have a table with users, their country and when they created the account. We want to find:
The country with the largest and smallest number of users
A query that returns for each country the first and the last user who signed up (if that
country has just one user, it should just return that single user)


My code:
1. 
SELECT country, ct
FROM(
	SELECT T.*, DENSE_RANK()OVER(order by ct)as rk, DENSE_RANK()OVER(order by ct DESC)as rk_DESC
	FROM(
		SELECT country, count(user_id) AS ct
		FROM query_six
		GROUP BY country
	)T
)TT 
WHERE RK=1 OR RK_DESC=1

2.
SELECT user_id, country, created_at
FROM(
	SELECT user_id, country, created_at, RANK()over(PARTITION by country order by created_at) as r1,  RANK()over(PARTITION by country order by created_at DESC) as r2
	From query_six
)T 
WHERE r1=1 or r2 =1
