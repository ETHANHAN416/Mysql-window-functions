Goal:
We have two tables. One table has all mobile actions, i.e. all pages visited by the users on mobile. 
The other table has all web actions, i.e. all pages visited on web by the users.
Write a query that returns the percentage of users who only visited mobile, only web and both.
That is, the percentage of users who are only in the mobile table, only in the web table and inboth tables. 
The sum of the percentages should return 1.


My code:
select sum(if(m>0 and w>0 ,1,0) )/count(distinct user_id) as bb, sum(if(m>0 and w=0, 1, 0))/count(distinct user_id) as m_only, sum(if(m=0 and w>0, 1, 0))/count(distinct user_id) as w_only
from 
(
	SELECT user_id, count(distinct m_page) as m, count(distinct w_page) as w
	from (
	select user_id, query_two_mobile.page as m_page, query_two_web.page as w_page
	from query_two_mobile
	left join query_two_web using (user_id)
	union 
	select user_id, query_two_mobile.page as m_page, query_two_web.page as w_page
	from query_two_mobile
	right join query_two_web using (user_id)
	) t
	group by user_id
)tmp
