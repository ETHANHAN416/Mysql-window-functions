Goal:
For each user_id, find the difference between the last action and the second last action. 
Action here is defined as visiting a page. 
If the user has just one action, you can either remove her from the final results or keep that user_id and have NULL as time difference between the two actions. 
The table shows for each user all the pages she visited and the corresponding
timestamp.

My code:
SELECT T2.user_id, fir - sec as diff
FROM( 
	SELECT user_id, UNIX_TIMESTAMP as sec 
	From 
	 (
		SELECT user_id, UNIX_TIMESTAMP, rank()over(partition by user_id order by UNIX_TIMESTAMP desc) as rk 
		From query_one
	)AAA
	where rk=2
) T1
RIGHT JOIN 
(
	SELECT user_id, UNIX_TIMESTAMP as fir 
	From 
	 (
		SELECT user_id, UNIX_TIMESTAMP, rank()over(partition by user_id order by UNIX_TIMESTAMP desc) as rk 
		From query_one
	)AAA
	where rk=1
) T2 USING (user_id)
ORDER BY T2.user_id
